Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n\n> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)\n\n**For help: Ask questions on the [Kaggle Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kaggle) server.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📖 Get started with Kaggle Notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using Kaggle Notebooks, welcome!

The output of one agent automatically becomes the input for the next, creating a predictable and reliable workflow.\n\n**Use Sequential when:** Order matters, you need a linear pipeline, or each step builds on the previous one.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [sequential agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Blog Post Creation Pipeline**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[\"User Input: Blog about AI\"] -- > B[\"Outline Agent\"]\n    B -- >|blog_outline| C[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    C -- >|blog_draft| D[\"Editor Agent\"]\n    D -- >|final_blog| E[\"Output\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ffcccc\n    style C fill:#ccffcc\n    style D fill:#ccccff\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"h6Bcds7EBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"1000\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/sequential-agent.png\" alt=\"Sequential Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.1 Example: Blog Post Creation with Sequential Agents\n\nLet's build a system with three specialized agents:\n\n1. **Outline Agent** - Creates a blog outline for a given topic\n2. **Writer Agent** - Writes a blog post\n3. **Editor Agent** - Edits a blog post draft for clarity and structure","metadata":{"id":"h6Bcds7EBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Outline Agent: Creates the initial blog post outline.\noutline_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"OutlineAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Create a blog outline for the given topic with:\n    1.

As he reached for a polishing cloth tucked into a crevice, his fingers brushed against something leathery. He pulled out a rolled parchment, brittle with age. Unfurling it, Elias gasped. It wasn't a logbook, but a map, unlike any he'd ever seen. Delicate lines of what looked like phosphorescent ink pulsed with a faint, internal light, depicting islands and currents that charted no known sea. A single, luminous 'X' marked a spot far out in the inky blackness of the ocean. The storm's fury seemed to fade as Elias’s heart began to beat a rhythm of awe and a touch of fear.\nCriticAgent > The story presents a compelling hook and an intriguing premise. Elias, the solitary lighthouse keeper, is an immediately relatable character, and the setting of a raging storm adds a palpable atmosphere. The discovery of the mysterious map is a strong inciting incident, generating immediate curiosity and a sense of wonder.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Deepen Elias's Reaction:** While Elias's gasp and the mention of awe and fear are good, consider expanding on his internal thoughts and feelings. What specific emotions surge through him? Does his solitary nature make this discovery even more profound? Does he question his sanity, or is his curiosity immediately paramount? Showing more of his immediate internal reaction could make him a more fully realized character.\n\n2.  **Hint at the Map's Origin or Purpose:** The map itself is wonderfully mysterious. To add another layer, consider a subtle clue about its origin or intended purpose. Is there a faded symbol on the parchment? Does the \"leathery\" feel suggest a specific type of animal hide or material? Even a small detail could spark further speculation and engagement from the reader.\n\n3.  **Consider a Foreshadowing Element:** The \"touch of fear\" is good, but you could subtly foreshadow potential danger or the significance of the map beyond just treasure. Perhaps as he looks at the 'X', a particularly violent gust of wind shakes the lighthouse, or a distant, strange sound is heard over the storm, linking the map's discovery to the outside world in a more ominous way.\nRefinerAgent > Elias, the solitary keeper of Black Rock Lighthouse, polished the Fresnel lens with his usual methodical strokes. The storm outside raged, a symphony of wind and wave, but inside, the lamp cast a comforting, steady beam. As he reached for a polishing cloth tucked into a crevice, his fingers brushed against something unexpectedly leathery—not the rough canvas he expected. He pulled out a rolled parchment, brittle with age. Unfurling it, Elias gasped. It wasn't a logbook, but a map, unlike any he'd ever seen. Delicate lines of what looked like phosphorescent ink pulsed with a faint, internal light, depicting islands and currents that charted no known sea. A single, luminous 'X' marked a spot far out in the inky blackness of the ocean.\n\nThe storm's fury seemed to fade as Elias’s heart began to beat a rhythm of awe and a touch of fear. Was he dreaming? The sheer isolation of his post, the endless horizon, had always been his world. Now, this impossible chart lay in his hands. His solitary existence amplified the profoundness of the discovery; this was a secret whispered only to him. He traced the glowing lines with a trembling finger, a man adrift between disbelief and an insatiable curiosity that overshadowed any rational thought. What ancient mariner, or something far stranger, had crafted this? The parchment felt strangely smooth, almost like cured sharkskin, and near the rolled edge, a faded symbol, a spiral within a circle, hinted at an origin beyond human reckoning.\n\nAs his gaze fixed on the luminous 'X', a gust of wind, more violent than any before, slammed against the lighthouse, rattling the very foundations. The tower groaned in protest, and a low, mournful sound, distinct from the storm's roar, seemed to emanate from the churning sea below. Elias clutched the map tighter, the parchment now feeling less like a promise of treasure and more like a harbinger of a storm far more significant than the one raging outside. His fear, once a mere \"touch,\" now settled cold and heavy in his gut, a stark counterpoint to the burning ember of wonder.\nCriticAgent > The story has significantly improved with the added details, making Elias's experience more vivid and the map's mystery more palpable. The expanded internal monologue and the specific sensory details about the parchment enhance the character and the object of discovery. The foreshadowing elements at the end effectively escalate the tension and hint at a larger, more significant event.\n\nThe plot is effectively set up with a clear inciting incident and a growing sense of unease. The character of Elias is becoming more defined through his reactions to the discovery. The pacing is well-handled, building from a quiet, methodical start to a suspenseful climax.\n\nHowever, there is one specific, actionable suggestion for improvement:\n\n*   **Clarify the \"Mournful Sound\":** The low, mournful sound emanating from the sea is a good touch of atmosphere, but its source and nature could be slightly more defined without losing its mystery. Is it an animalistic sound? A deep, resonant hum? Describing it with one or two more evocative adjectives could make it more distinct from the storm's general roar and more specifically tied to the map's influence, without revealing too much. For example, is it like a distant, sorrowful whale song, or a deep vibration that Elias feels in his bones?\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
